# fizzBuzz-discoTiles
Languages used are: +HTML +CSS and +Vanilla JS

When I was looking into coding waaay back in 2015 I came across and old at the time coding interview question calle Fizz Buzz. I found it in a JavaScript book and also heard Matt Mullenweg talk about it on Tim Ferriss' podcast as an interview question for Automattic (Wordpress). As I understand this problem started being used about fifteen years ago and I imagine is not used much anymore. As the level of coding that is required for a basic entry-level position increases, this has most likely been replaced with a more difficult or complex problem, but for nostalgia's sake I wanted to make something with it.

The intended purpose of this web app is to use the Fizz Buzz algorithm to dynamically generate a 10x10 grid of squares, coloring the squares depending on their return value (fizz, buzz, fizzbuzz, or number). Then use a keyframes animation that loops to change those colors and add some glittery effects that make them "light up" in squence to create a sort of disco light-looking thing in the browser.

This is the first project that I have done without a guide or tutorial leading the way so I have no idea how it is going to turn out. If you are reading this, please be patient and kind. If you see any bugs or ways that I have missed best practices please let me know. I love constructive feedback.
